<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
       A little about me. My name is Jakub. I was born in Poland and moved to Chicago when I was around
four years old. A couple years later, my family moved again to Romeoville. Fast forward to the
present day, and I still live in Romeoville. I am currently attending Lewis University as a junior
transfer student from Joliet Junior College. I'm hoping to complete my major in Computer Science.
I haven't decided on a specific concentration yet, or even if I want to pursue one. I'll just have
to see whether a particular concentration stands out for me as I complete more courses.
</p>

<h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>

<ul class="a">
       <li>Gain a better understanding of coding</li>
       <li>Learn more about various programming languages and their uses</li>
       <li>Best tools and methods to use to code and organize files</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>

<p>
       I would have to say my favorite hobby is probably basketball. Between work and school, it 
becomes difficult to find time to do something other than eat and sleep. However, when I do find I
have some free time, I like to play basketball. I get together with some friends and maybe we go to
the rec center, or maybe we go to a local park, or even play in someone's driveway. There is always
food at some point when we play, so that makes it all the more enjoyable.

<h2>Fun Fact</h2>
